# Observant Systems
-------------

Two ideas:
### 1. Playing to be God 
In my personal Instagram I have a channel called Playing to be God. In it, I typically upload videos recorded with my phone, and while my right hand holds the phone, my left hand appears in the video, playing with the screen somehow. I usually make some sounds as sound effects of what is going on. My idea was to use the Pi camera to capture these interactions and make sounds when my hand collapses with a person. Find a sketch attached. 
After trying several scripts (you can find the last version of it in the 'PlayingToBeGod' folder), I realized that the latency makes my game almost impossible, and if possible it would probably make no sense. So I pivoted towards my next idea: Measuring Art Engagement in galeries.

### 2. Measuring Art Engagement - The winner :)

My second idea is about measuring the connection between art visitors and pieces of art in a museum. Ideally we could use biometrics data to understand what the users are feeling about certain pieces of art and understand the connection or engagement levels between these to actors. In this case, I have simplified the problem by calculating the time each user spends looking at different pieces of art. To do so, I have used a Teachable Machine. Please, find an early sketch of my idea:

## ✅ Prep
- Read about [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/about/).
- Read Belloti, et al's [Making Sense of Sensing Systems: Five Questions for Designers and Researchers](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~keith/pubs/chi2002-sensing.pdf)

## Overview
Building upon the paper-airplane metaphor (we're understanding the material of machine learning for design), here are the four sections of the lab activity:

A) [Play](#part-a)

B) [Fold](#part-b)

C) [Flight test](#part-c)

D) [Reflect](#part-d)

---

### ✅ Part A
### Play with different sense-making algorithms.
#### OpenCV
A more traditional to extract information out of images is provided with OpenCV. The RPI image provided to you comes with an optimized installation that can be accessed through python.

Additionally, we also included 4 standard OpenCV examples. These examples include contour(blob) detection, face detection with the ``Haarcascade``, flow detection(a type of keypoint tracking), and standard object detection with the [Yolo](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/) darknet.

Most examples can be run with a screen (I.e. VNC or ssh -X or with an HDMI monitor), or with just the terminal. The examples are separated out into different folders. Each folder contains a ```HowToUse.md``` file, which explains how to run the python example.

```shell
pi@ixe00:~/openCV-examples $ tree -l

#### Teachable Machines (beta, optional)
Google's [TeachableMachines](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/train) might look very simple.  However, its simplicity is very useful for experimenting with the capabilities of this technology.

You can train a Model on your browser, experiment with its performance, and then port it to the Raspberry Pi to do even its task on the device.

Here is Adafruit's directions on using Raspberry Pi and the Pi camera with Teachable Machines:

1. [Setup](https://learn.adafruit.com/teachable-machine-raspberry-pi-tensorflow-camera/raspberry-pi-setup)
2. Install Tensorflow: Like [this](https://learn.adafruit.com/running-tensorflow-lite-on-the-raspberry-pi-4/tensorflow-lite-2-setup), but use this [pre-built binary](https://github.com/bitsy-ai/tensorflow-arm-bin/) [the file](https://github.com/bitsy-ai/tensorflow-arm-bin/releases/download/v2.4.0/tensorflow-2.4.0-cp37-none-linux_armv7l.whl) for Tensorflow, it will speed things up a lot.
3. [Collect data and train models using the PiCam](https://learn.adafruit.com/teachable-machine-raspberry-pi-tensorflow-camera/training)
4. [Export and run trained models on the Pi](https://learn.adafruit.com/teachable-machine-raspberry-pi-tensorflow-camera/transferring-to-the-pi)

Alternative less steps option is [here](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/TensorflowonThePi).

#### PyTorch  
As a note, the global Python install contains also a PyTorch installation. That can be experimented with as well if you are so inclined.

---
### Part B
### Construct a simple interaction.

Pick one of the models you have tried, pick a class of objects, and experiment with prototyping an interaction.
This can be as simple as the boat detector earlier.
Try out different interactions outputs and inputs.
**Describe and detail the interaction, as well as your experimentation.**

---

### Part C
### Test the interaction prototype

Now flight test your interactive prototype and **note your observations**:
For example:
1. When does it what it is supposed to do?
1. When does it fail?
1. When it fails, why does it fail?
1. Based on the behavior you have seen, what other scenarios could cause problems?

**Think about someone using the system. Describe how you think this will work.**
1. Are they aware of the uncertainties in the system?
1. How bad would they be impacted by a miss classification?
1. How could change your interactive system to address this?
1. Are there optimizations you can try to do on your sense-making algorithm.

---
### Part D
### Characterize your own Observant system

Now that you have experimented with one or more of these sense-making systems **characterize their behavior**.
During the lecture, we mentioned questions to help characterize a material:
* What can you use X for?
* What is a good environment for X?
* What is a bad environment for X?
* When will X break?
* When it breaks how will X break?
* What are other properties/behaviors of X?
* How does X feel?

**Include a short video demonstrating the answers to these questions.**

---
### Part 2.

Following exploration and reflection from Part 1, finish building your interactive system, and demonstrate it in use with a video.

**Include a short video demonstrating the finished result.**
